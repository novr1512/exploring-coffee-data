# exploring-coffee-data

Coffee is a famous drink in every country although it only grows in specific countries.

It's produced by planting coffee beans then harvesting the farm.
The following step is roasting the beans then grounding them into smaller pieces.
The final step is preparing the cup by pouring hot (or cold water) over it 

This simple process shows that the beans are the most important part to get the perfect cup of coffee.
so the question is :
##### how do we know where can we get the high-quality beans?
##### what factors can play a role into producing higher quality beans?

### About the dataset
